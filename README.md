<h1>Premise</h1>
<p>This is the final project for our Data Structures class at Georgia Southern.</p>
<p>Our only requirement was to use a data structure that we learned in class for this project.</p>
<p>We choose to create two minigames in the game engine Unity that use the concept of the data structures as the main mechanic.</p>
<p>This idea came from wanting to try and inform or teach players about a data structure in a fun and intuitive way even if they were not computer scientist.</p>
<p>Tyler Hodzen worked on the linked list game and I worked on the stack game.</p>

<h1>What we learned</h1>
<p>This project enhanced our knowledge of the Unity game engine and C# as well.</p>
<p>This was my first experience using particles in Unity along with prefabs.</p>

<h1>Additional Notes</h1>
<p>The music used in this project was not created by us.</p>
<p>The music for the stack game comes from The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and belongs to Nintendo.</p>
<p>All other music is avaliable in the free domain</p>
<p>The sound effects in the stack game were created by me.</p>
<p>The "Wow" sound effect in the linked list game comes from the game parodius.</p>
